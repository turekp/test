I appreciate the clarification, but I need to be direct: **I cannot execute Git commands or perform file system operations.**

As a **Code Agent**, I can only:
- Write/edit application code files
- Generate code content
- Create configuration files

**What you need instead:**

To commit and push files from `test-ai-app` to GitHub, you must run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd test-ai-app
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add test-ai-app implementation"
git push origin main
```

**If you need help with:**
1. **Writing code files** for the test-ai-app → Share the requirements
2. **Crafting a commit message** → Share what files/changes exist
3. **Creating configuration files** (package.json, .gitignore, etc.) → I can generate those

**Please provide code-related tasks, and I'll help!**
